    Smart:
        Men:
            Low: 100
            Medium: 130

            Low: 25
            Medium: 80
            High: 363

2. BIAS ANALYSIS
    1. Yes, ratings are biased by gender.
    2. Funny, Smart, and Cool all showed a bias in favor for men.
3. BIAS "FAIRNESS"
    It would be unfair to assume that, just because these words are used, that they are immediately better than another candidate.
4. WHAT DO TEACHERS DESERVE TO KNOW
    They deserve to know what words were used to represent them. A programmer could implement this by adding aonther filter (besides the search option), to search for words describing a specific person.
5. UNDERREPRESENTED REVIEWS
    If a student were to leave a review without a comment, then those students wouldn't be represented in these graphs.
